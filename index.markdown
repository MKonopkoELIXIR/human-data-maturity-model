Several Maturity Models are being created in the human health data sharing space to support the advancement of broad, Europe-wide data sharing for precision medicine. These models take the perspectives of different sectors or decision-making levels, but generally avoid dictating the use of a specific set of standards to allow for flexibility and broader use of the models.

However, some groups may want more detailed guidance to meet the needs of their maturation, an aligned maturity model needs to be created to outline some internationally accepted standards in the human genomics data sharing space which support ELIXIRâ€™s vision.

The aim of this Maturity Model is to create a guide which can be used by technical decision makers to support the organisational data-sharing maturation strategy which they are tasked to execute. It should help bridge the gap between the goals of the high level decision makers and the actions of the technical implementers.

Ultimately, this model should support technical leads in human data sharing projects and organisations, provide concrete steps in supporting operational goals through the use of standards, align with existing related projects, and support the ELIXIR HGTD vision from the ground up.
